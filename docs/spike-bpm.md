# BPM steerability — spike findings

Measured 2026-06-10 on `mrt2_small` (script: `backend/scripts/spike_bpm.py`):
16 s generations of "driving techno, four on the floor, {N} bpm", tempo
estimated with librosa beat tracking (octave-tolerant, ±12%).

| Requested | Estimated | Tracks? |
| --------- | --------- | ------- |
| 90 bpm | 144.2 | ✗ |
| 120 bpm | 130.8 | ✓ |
| 150 bpm | 148.0 | ✓ |

**Conclusion:** prompt-based tempo steering is real but *partial* — the model
follows the hint within a style's plausible tempo range and ignores it
outside (techno refuses to crawl at 90). Per the roadmap's M4 rule ("the UI
only exposes the tempo control that actually works"):

- ~~**Ship:** an optional per-deck *tempo hint* appended to the prompt
  text before embedding, labelled as a hint.~~ **Removed after round 3**
  (below): the hint sometimes pushes tempo the *wrong* way, so a dedicated
  control implies agency that doesn't exist. Typing "…, 128 bpm" into a
  style prompt does the same thing, with honest expectations.
- **Don't ship:** per-deck nudge/sync, beat-matching, or anything implying
  the model obeys exact tempos. Revisit only if a future MRT exposes real
  tempo conditioning.

## Follow-up: injected beat clock (2026-06-10)

MRT2 also takes per-frame `drums` (and 128-pitch `notes`) conditioning with
its own CFG scale, so we tried steering tempo with a pulse train — a MIDI
clock in conditioning space (`backend/scripts/spike_midi_clock.py`,
`spike_midi_clock2.py`). 16 s generations, beat-tracked; the style's
natural tempo is ~131 bpm.

| Variant | 88 bpm | 100 bpm | 125 bpm | 150 bpm |
| ------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| drums pulse, `0` between ticks, cfg 4 | 131 ✗ | 131 ✗ | 131 ✓* | 131 ✗ |
| drums pulse, masked between ticks, cfg 4 | — | **104 ✓** | — | 131 ✗ |
| note-onset pulse (C2), cfg 4 | — | 131 ✗ | — | 131 ✗ |
| drums pulse, masked, cfg 7 | — | 131 ✗ | — | 131 ✗ |
| clock + matching text hint, cfg 7 | — | 131 ✗ | — | **144 ~** |

\* coincidence: 131 is within tolerance of the 125 request.

**Conclusion:** sparse pulse trains do not reliably entrain the model —
results scatter around the style's preferred tempo with occasional ±10%
pulls, and no variant reproduces across tempos. Likely the drums channel
was trained on dense activity derived from real audio (drums are "on"
nearly continuously in drum-driven music), so a 1-frame-in-15 click reads
as "mostly no drums", not as a clock. **No clock feature ships.** Worth
revisiting if upstream documents the conditioning's training distribution
or an example shows transcription-shaped conditioning steering rhythm.

## Round 3: clock + text combined, repeated trials (2026-06-10)

`backend/scripts/spike_midi_clock3.py` — text-only vs clock-only vs both,
3 trials each at the contested tempos:

| Condition | target 100 | target 88.2 |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| text hint only | 141, 141, 141 ✗ | 148, 148, 148 ✗ |
| masked clock only | 104, 104, 104 "✓" | **104**, 104, 104 ✗ |
| both | 128, 128, 128 ✗ | 148, 148, 148 ✗ |

Two findings that close the question:

1. **Generation from the exported `.mlxfn` is deterministic** given the
   same conditioning — the sampler's RNG state ships inside
   `*_state.safetensors`. Repeated trials are exact repeats, so none of
   the earlier round-to-round differences were sampling noise.
2. **The clock rate is not interpreted as a rate.** A 100 bpm clock and an
   88 bpm clock both land on ~104 bpm: the sparse-drums conditioning drags
   output toward a slower-groove attractor regardless of pulse period —
   it acts as a drum-density/feel knob, not a tempo input. The round-2
   "lock" at 100 was that attractor coinciding with the request.
   Combining with the text hint just lands on a third attractor, no
   closer to the target.
